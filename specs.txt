Expressions

0 - GameRectX
1 - GameRectY
2 - GameRectWidth
3 - GameRectHeight
	These give us the "actual" width and height in pixels of the blown-up game onscreen

4 - ManualGameRectX
5 - ManualGameRectY
6 - ManualGameRectWidth
7 - ManualGameRectHeight
	The stored values for the manual mode

8 - CroppedGameWidth
9 - CroppedGameHeight
	These will always be the normal window size when "preserve" is enabled.
	When MatchWidth or MatchHeight are used, this tells us what parts of the game window had
	to be cropped off.  This might be useful for moving HUD elements, etc.
